## Explanation: ##

When we work on machine learning models, we expect model success to be high.
92% of these installed models, etc. guessing correctly with odds may sound good.
These success rates can be misleading for us. In this article, I will discuss the model complexity issue in order to prevent over-learning.

## Purpose: ## 

We will examine the analysis of model complexity with learning curves through an application.
I used Titanic dataset in this application. The dataset contains information about the people involved in the Titanic shipwreck.
In this project, I tried to estimate the probability of survival of people whose characteristics are given.
